                        <h4>During my master's program at UW-Madison, I was assigned a fun project of creating a multi-staged bicycle race map overlaying a shaded relief basemap. I choose to have the race located in Europe because I thought the Alps would be aesthetically pleasing in my map. After creating this map, I someday hope to travel this route(probably not by bike). I'll be sure to update this page, about the adventure, if I ever do.

                        <h4>This infographic I created was another assignment I had during my master's program. We were assigned to create an engaging narrative using a bivariate map, which we also created, and included other supporting data. I made this assignment more meaningful with a topic about homeless veterans. As a veteran who has associations with many veterans, I understand that many veterans need help and support in ways they currently aren't recieving. I wanted to create this infographic to tell a story about how we are failing veterans and homeless veterans in the United States, and that only actions of care and support can change this.

                        <h4>Towards the end of my bachelor's degree at UW-Milwaukee, I was required to take a fieldwork course that assigned me to Schlitz Audubon Nature Center(SANC). I was glad to be assigned to SANC for my fieldwork because I had previously volunteered there to remove invasive plants. The map above I created with a fellow student during the fieldwork, in which we collected data points on a Species of Concern in Wisconsin, the Prairie Crayfish. The dashed yellow lines in the map are lines we walked to find crayfish burrows.
