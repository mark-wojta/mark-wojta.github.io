            <h4>The final project in my master's program through UW-Madison was created in April, 2021, while taking the practicum course. This Wisconsin School District Explorer and the idea for this project were designed by me, which was signficant because this was the first project involving intensive coding that I was able to create and finish by myself. The majority of this project was coded using ArcGIS API for JavaScript and creating this project was a fulfilling way to finish my master's degree.

            <h4>Above is the link to the second project I completed in the capstone course I was enrolled in during my last semester of my master's program at UW-Madison. This project was created in April, 2021, mainly using ArcGIS API for JavaScript. Creating the Schlitz Audubon Nature Center (SANC) Visitor App was a great way to come full circle in finishing up my master's program as my GIS experience started with a fieldwork course and an internship at SANC while I was obtaining my bachelor's degree.

This application's maps were coded using Python's ArcPy package and the graphical user interface was coded with Python's TkInter. The capstone course's first project was a nice way to test out what I learned from my master's program.

            <h4>The Severe Weather Wisconsin application was created in December, 2020, as the final project in a geospatial web and mobile programming course during my master's program at UW-Madison. I created this project with 2 classmates which was done using front-end and back-end coding. The PostgreSQL geodatabase that this application accesses data from was created and hosted through pgAdmin. Java servlets were coded and used to allow the application's interface to communicate with our geodatabase. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create our application's interface page. This project was a useful learning experience in understanding how multiple coding languages can be used together to create products.

Working with two group members, we were able to solve our research questions on LA County, California's traffic patterns. This was a great learning experience about how a database can be used in research of traffic issues in one of the most densely populated U.S. counties.

            <h4>In July of 2020, I created this real GDP map for an interactive cartographic design course during my master's program at UW-Madison. This was the first map I created while learning about JavaScript and really introduced me to how coding can be used to enhance GIS. This map was created with Leaflet API and the jQuery library.

I choose the location of this multi-staged bicycle race map, overlaying a shaded relief basemap, in Europe because I thought the Alps would be aesthetically pleasing in the map. After creating this map, I someday hope to travel this route(probably not by bike). I'll be sure to update this page about the adventure if I ever do.

            <h4>I created this infographic in February of 2020, while taking a graphic design in cartography course during my master's program at UW-Madison. We were assigned to create an engaging narrative using supporting data and a bivariate map, which we also made. This assignment was more meaningful because of the topic I choose about veterans and homeless veterans. Having many veteran family and friends, I understand that there are too many veterans that need help and support in ways they currently aren't receiving. I created this infographic to tell a story about where we are failing homeless veterans in the United States and that only proper support and resources can change this.

            <h4>Towards the end of my bachelor's degree at UW-Milwaukee, in June of 2019, I was required to take a fieldwork course that assigned me to Schlitz Audubon Nature Center(SANC). I was glad to be assigned to SANC for my fieldwork because I had previously volunteered there to remove invasive plants. The map above I created with a fellow student during the fieldwork, in which we collected data points on a Species of Concern in Wisconsin, the Prairie Crayfish. The dashed yellow lines in the map are lines we walked while observing the property for crayfish burrows.
