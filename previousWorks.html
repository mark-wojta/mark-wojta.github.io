            <h4>This fun project was created in March of 2020, while taking a Graphic Design in Cartography course during my master's program at UW-Madison. I choose the location of this multi-staged bicycle race map, overlaying a shaded relief basemap, in Europe because I thought the Alps would be aesthetically pleasing in the map. After creating this map, I someday hope to travel this route(probably not by bike). I'll be sure to update this page about the adventure if I ever do.

            <h4>I created this infographic in February of 2020, while taking a Graphic Design in Cartography course during my master's program at UW-Madison. We were assigned to create an engaging narrative using supporting data and a bivariate map, which we also made. This assignment was more meaningful because of the topic I choose about veterans and homeless veterans. As a veteran myself, and having many veteran friends, I understand that there are too many veterans that need help and support in ways they currently aren't receiving. I created this infographic to tell a story about where we are failing homeless veterans in the United States and that only proper support and resources can change this.

            <h4>Towards the end of my bachelor's degree at UW-Milwaukee, in June of 2019, I was required to take a fieldwork course that assigned me to Schlitz Audubon Nature Center(SANC). I was glad to be assigned to SANC for my fieldwork because I had previously volunteered there to remove invasive plants. The map above I created with a fellow student during the fieldwork, in which we collected data points on a Species of Concern in Wisconsin, the Prairie Crayfish. The dashed yellow lines in the map are lines we walked while observing the property for crayfish burrows.
